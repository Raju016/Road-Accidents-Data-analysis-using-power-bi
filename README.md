# Road Accidents Analysis Dashboard – Power BI
The Road Accidents Analysis Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of accident trends across various categories such as vehicle type, severity, lighting conditions, geography, and road types. The total number of current year (CY) casualties stands at 195.7K, showing a decline of 11.9% from the previous year. Similarly, total CY accidents are recorded at 144.4K, down by 11.7%, indicating potential improvements in road safety or reporting measures.

## Vehicle Type Insights
Among the various vehicle types involved in accidents, cars (155.8K) and bikes (15.6K) account for the highest number of casualties, followed by vans (15.9K) and buses (6.5K). The category “others” and agricultural vehicles contribute relatively smaller shares. These insights suggest prioritizing safety campaigns and regulations targeted at high-risk vehicle types.

## Monthly & Weekly Trends
The dashboard illustrates monthly trends comparing CY and PY casualties, revealing higher incident rates in early months and reductions later in the year. Friday has the highest number of accidents (~51K), followed by other weekdays around 44–46K, and Sunday with the lowest (~34K). These patterns support traffic enforcement strategies focused on peak days.

## Geographic & Environmental Factors
Urban areas account for 61.95% of all CY casualties, while rural regions contribute 38.05%, highlighting the need for urban infrastructure and awareness. Accidents under daylight conditions dominate at 73.84%, while 26.16% occur in the dark, emphasizing the role of visibility and lighting in accident prevention.

## Road Type Distribution
The majority of accidents occur on single carriageways (145K), followed by dual carriageways (32K) and others like roundabouts, one-way streets, and slip roads. These insights are critical for infrastructure planning, sign placements, and driver awareness programs.

## Accident Severity Breakdown
Slight injuries: 263.28K

Serious injuries: 40.74K

Fatalities: 3.95K

This breakdown provides essential data for emergency response planning, traffic control, and public safety policy development.

## Strategic Implications
Vehicle Focused Safety Campaigns – Target car and bike safety, as they account for the majority of road casualties.

Infrastructure Planning – Single carriageways show the highest accident numbers, suggesting urgent design or monitoring improvements.

Weekend Enforcement – Friday sees the highest accident volume; increase visibility and check-posts on high-traffic days.

Urban Safety Enhancement – Majority of accidents happen in urban zones, calling for improved traffic management, lighting, and surveillance.

Severity-Aware Policy Making – Fatality data guides emergency response planning and medical infrastructure preparedness.
